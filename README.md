# SOC Estimation For Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Particle Swarm Optimization On Adaptive Square-Root Cubature Kalman Filter - Energy Storage Systems Project

## Project Objectives

1. Understanding the working of an Adaptive Square Root Cubature Kalman Filter (ASRCKF).
2. Comparison of ASRCKF with other generic variants of the Kalman Filter.
3. Optimization of ASRCKF to obtain an accurate estimation of State of Charge (SOC) of a battery (Li-ion battery meant for automobile use in the case of the reference paper).
4. Comparison of various optimization methods to achieve the above mentioned objective.
5. Understanding the necessity of an accurate estimate of SOC
